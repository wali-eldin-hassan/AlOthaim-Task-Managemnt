## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) (v8.0 or above)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or another supported database
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) (if using Redis for caching or queueing)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-system.git
cd task-management-system


### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install PHP dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

Next, install the front-end dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, update the `.env` file with your database, mail, and other required configurations.

### Step 4: Generate Application Key

Generate the application encryption key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### Step 5: Set Up the Database

Ensure that your database is running, and run the following commands to create the database tables and seed some initial data:

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

### Step 6: Serve the Application

You can serve the application using Laravelâ€™s built-in development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to view the application.

## Configuration

You need to configure the `.env` file to match your local setup.

### Key Configurations:
- **Database Settings**:
    - `DB_CONNECTION`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`
- **Mail Settings**:
    - `MAIL_MAILER`, `MAIL_HOST`, `MAIL_PORT`, `MAIL_USERNAME`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`, `MAIL_ENCRYPTION`, `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`
- **Queue/Cache Settings**:
    - `CACHE_DRIVER=redis` and `QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis` (if using Redis)

## Running the Application

Once installed, you can run the application as you would with any Laravel application. To watch and build frontend assets in development mode, use the following:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production builds, you can run:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Testing

This project uses PHPUnit and Pest for automated testing.

### Running the Tests

You can run the test suite using Pest:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest
```

Or, with parallel testing to speed up the test runs:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --parallel
```

If you're using PHPUnit:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Ensure you have a dedicated test database configured in your `.env` file for testing.
